SolDrip is the first Solana token with real-time slippage optimization that automatically converts 5% of each transaction tax into SOL cash flow, precisely distributed to token holders every 5 minutes. Our innovative technology ensures you receive your SOL dividends directly to your wallet without staking requirements.

## Key Features

### ⚡ Lightning Dividend Engine
- Automatically exchanges transaction taxes to SOL via Jupiter aggregator
- Smart contract triggers dividends every 0.1 SOL accumulated (approximately 5-minute cycles)
- Distribution formula: Your earnings = (Your holdings / Total supply) × Dividend pool SOL balance × 0.98
  (2% used for on-chain computation gas costs)

### 🛡️ Anti-Fragile Liquidity Mechanism
- 1% transaction tax automatically injected into LP pool at 50/50 ratio
- Slippage protection mode activated when price fluctuates >15%:
  - Pauses dividends for 10 minutes
  - Uses 80% of current tax collection for market buybacks

### 🐳 Transparent Anti-Whale System
- Maximum holdings per address ≤3% of total supply
- For large sales (>0.2% of total supply):
  - Transaction tax increases to 8%
  - Additional 3% tax injected into 24-hour delayed dividend pool

4. **Holding Bonus**: Hold for 7+ days to receive 1.1x dividend multiplier
5. **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor your earnings through our transparent dashboard
